## <a id="about">Why WinUX?</a>
I've been developing Windows apps since 2010 and with each project, I noticed a pattern of repeating similar XAML controls and extensions. This involved a lot of copy and pasting.

The aim of WinUX was to fix just that! WinUX provides a core collection of extensions to the Windows app platform to make it easier for developers to make their apps great, without the time and effort of in adding common functionality.

## <a id="features">What's in the box</a>
Information on what's contained within the toolkit will be coming soon. Please check back later.

## <a id="components">Get the components</a>
If you're not looking to get the complete WinUX toolkit, you can easily get your hands on the core components (available on Nuget) for your Windows app needs.
